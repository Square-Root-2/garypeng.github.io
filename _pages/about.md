My name is Gary Peng, a fourth-year computer science and mathematics double major at the University of M1aryland, College Park. I am broadly interested in mechanism design and algorithms/complexity, and I am currently working on two-sided markets and lower bounds for biclique. In my (young) research career, I am grateful to have been advised by [Mohammad Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/), [Karthik C.S.](https://cskarthikcs.github.io/), and [Suho Shin](https://suhoshin.github.io/).

I am currently applying to Ph.D. programs in computer science for Fall 2026. Feel free to reach out!
